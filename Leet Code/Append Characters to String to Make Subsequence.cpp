/* Title - Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence */

// You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

// Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

// A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
// Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
// It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
// Example 2:

// Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"
// Output: 0
// Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").
// Example 3:

// Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
// Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
// It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.

public:
    int appendCharacters(string s, string t) {
        int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
            if(s[i]==t[j])j++;
        return t.length()-j;
    }
};
